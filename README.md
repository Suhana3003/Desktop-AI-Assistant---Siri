# Desktop-AI-Assistant---Siri

In this project I made a desktop voice assistant SIRI using Python.

I started by creating a wishme() function first that gives the greeting func‐ tionality according to our A.I system time using the datetime module.

After wishme() function, I created a takeCommand() function, which helps SIRI to take command from the user. This function is also responsible for returning the user’s query in a string format.

It can do various tasks such as sending emails on your behalf, searching Wikipedia, opening websites like Google, Youtube, etc., in a web browser, or any application with a single voice command.
